                     Provide the  Survey Questions Generation based on a comprehensive analysis ,adhering to the following guidelines:
                1. ensure the output in json structure
                2. Ensure the text in formal British English, ensuring advanced grammar, precision, and professionalism tone              
                3. Develop a set of {survey_data["questionCount"]} questions, ensuring a diverse range of question types, including multiple-choice, checkbox, Likert scale, and open-ended questions.

                Structure Guide as the reference : 

                1. Multiple Choice:
                    {multiple_choice}

                2. Checkbox (Select All That Apply):
                    {checkbox}

                3. Likert Scale (1â€“5):
                    {likert_scale}

                4. Open-Ended (Short Answer):
                    {open_ended}
